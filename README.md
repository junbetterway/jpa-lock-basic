# Handling Database Concurrency Conflicts with JPA locking, Hibernate, Spring Data and Spring Retry

There are two ways to handle database concurrency conflicts provided by the Java Persistence API (JPA):

* Using optimistic locking
Detect the issue and react to it. 

* Using pessimistic locking 
Do not let the system get into such situations by preventing it.

This codebase provides the basic handling of database concurrrency conflicts with the aide of Hibernate, Spring Data and Spring Retry
